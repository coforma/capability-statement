## We build ethical technology products that disrupt the status quo through Human-Centered Design and research.

&Partners helps government define areas of opportunity and craft requirements that meet both partner and usersâ€™ needs. By design, we operate on both sides of the contract solicitation to mitigate the risks of business partners expecting outcomes different than the results, users disliking the service or product, and partner business objectives not being met.  

We also partner with industry to seamlessly integrate design into product development. We are experts in leading design that meets business goals, builds alignment, and delivers value through technically feasible and iterative design activities: Design Translation and DesignOps.
